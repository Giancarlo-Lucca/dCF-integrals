You will find a file containing the complete experimental results in testing. In this file, each sheet corresponds to a fuzzy measure. For each one, we have as many groups as functions F. Also, the rows are related to the different datasets where we provide the available accuracy mean. The columns are related with the RDFs used in the study, where D1 to D5 are the different deltas. Observe that D0 is the original CF-integral (it makes usage of the difference operator), thus, for this case we adopted the original Id. of the function.
