In it you will find a file containing the results obtained in the experimental results. In this file, each sheet corresponds to a fuzzy measure. For each sheet , the rows are related with the different datasets  used in the study and is available the obtained accuracy mean considering the five different dissimilarities used in the study and the original function.
